1.  Variables in JavaScript.

-   Variables are containers for data. You store data in a variable so you can reuse or manipulate it.   

| Keyword | Can reassign?                                                              | Scope            |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `var`   | Yes                                                                        | Function scope   |
| `let`   | Yes                                                                        | Block scope `{}` |
| `const` | No (value can't be reassigned, but object/array properties can be mutated) | Block scope `{}` |

2.  Data Types in JavaScript.

-   Primitive Data types:
    
    In JavaScript, primitive data types are the most basic data types, representing single 
    values and lacking properties or methods. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot 
    be changed after creation. These types are stored directly in the stack memory, which is 
    faster to access than the heap. 

    | Type      | Example         |
    | --------- | --------------- |
    | String    | `"Hello"`       |
    | Number    | `42`, `3.14`    |
    | Boolean   | `true`, `false` |
    | Undefined | `let x;`        |
    | Null      | `let x = null;` |
    | Symbol    | `Symbol("id")`  |


3.  Operators in JavaScript.

->  Arithmetic Operators: 

    Arithmetic Operators in JS are used to perform math operations.

    | Operator        | Example  | Result |
    | --------------- | -------- | ------ |
    | `+`             | `5 + 3`  | `8`    |
    | `-`             | `5 - 3`  | `2`    |
    | `*`             | `5 * 3`  | `15`   |
    | `/`             | `6 / 3`  | `2`    |
    | `%` (modulus)   | `5 % 3`  | `2`    |
    | `**` (exponent) | `2 ** 3` | `8`    |

->  Comparison Operators: 
    
    Comparison Operators in JS are used to compare two values -- returns true or false.  

    | Operator | Meaning                      | Example               |
    | -------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
    | `==`     | equal (loose)                | `5 == '5'` â†’ `true`   |
    | `===`    | equal (strict, type + value) | `5 === '5'` â†’ `false` |
    | `!=`     | not equal (loose)            | `5 != '5'` â†’ `false`  |
    | `!==`    | not equal (strict)           | `5 !== '5'` â†’ `true`  |
    | `>`      | greater than                 | `5 > 3` â†’ `true`      |
    | `<`      | less than                    | `5 < 3` â†’ `false`     |
    | `>=`     | greater or equal             | `5 >= 5` â†’ `true`     |
    | `<=`     | less or equal                | `5 <= 4` â†’ `false`    |

    Important: ðŸ‘‰ Always prefer === and !== over == and != to avoid type coercion bugs!

->  Logical Operators:

    Logical Operators in JS are used to combine conditions.

    | Operator | Meaning                    | Example                  |
    | -------- | -------------------------- | -----------------------  |
    | `&&`     | AND (both true)            | `true && true` â†’ `true`  |
    | `||`     | OR  (Either one is true)   | `true || false` â†’ `true` |
    | `!`      | NOT (negate)               | `!true` â†’ `false`        |

->  Assignment Operators:

    Assignment operators in JavaScript are used to assign values to variables. The most basic 
    assignment operator is the equals sign (=), which assigns the value on the right to the 
    variable on the left. 

    | Operator | Example  | Equivalent to |
    | -------- | -------- | ------------- |
    | `=`      | `x = 5`  | assign 5      |
    | `+=`     | `x += 2` | `x = x + 2`   |
    | `-=`     | `x -= 2` | `x = x - 2`   |
    | `*=`     | `x *= 2` | `x = x * 2`   |
    | `/=`     | `x /= 2` | `x = x / 2`   |

    There are also compound assignment operators, which combine an arithmetic or bitwise 
    operation with assignment. These operators perform the operation on the variable and the 
    value on the right, and then assign the result back to the variable.

    Example: +=, -=, *=, /= etc.


4.  Conditionals in JavaScript.

-   In Programming, conditionals allow your program to make decisions.
    In simple words: "If something is true, do this. Otherwise, do that."

    (Theory interview questions)

    1.  Syntax for Ternary operator is condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;

    2.  The difference between 'if...else' and 'if...else if...else' is 'if...else' condition 
        is used when we don't want to check multiple conditions we just rely on a single 
        condition i.e. if that condition evaluates to true we execute the code inside if block 
        and if false than the code inside the else block is executed a shorthand for if...else is
        using Ternary operator. And if we want to check multiple conditions we use 'if...else if...else' 
        chain.

    3. When the conditon is simple you can make use of the ternary operator.
